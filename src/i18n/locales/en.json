        "options": {
          "o1": "Accelerate to pass through before it turns red.",
          "o2": "Stop before the stop line, unless you are so close that to stop safely would cause an accident.",
          "o3": "Continue at the same speed as it means the lights are about to turn green."

      "q2": {
        "text": "What does a green filter arrow (e.g., for turning left) at traffic lights indicate when the main light is red?",
        "options": {
          "o1": "You may turn left if the way is clear, but give way to pedestrians crossing.",
          "o2": "You must wait for the main green light before turning left.",
          "o3": "You have priority over all other traffic and pedestrians when turning left."
