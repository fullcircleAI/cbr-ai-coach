### 1. **DIRECTORY CORRECTION:**
- ✅ Now running from correct directory (`cbr-ai-coach`)
- ✅ All new features now visible locally
- ✅ App working perfectly on http://localhost:5173

### 2. **VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FORCED:**
- ✅ Version updated to v2.3
- ✅ All changes pushed to GitHub
- ✅ New deployment triggered

---

## 🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

### **📱 LOCAL TESTING (WORKING):**
1. **Visit:** http://localhost:5173
2. **Test all features:**
   - ✅ Splash screen (2.5 seconds)
   - ✅ AI Tutor floating button (😊)
   - ✅ Mock exam unlock system
   - ✅ Exam Readiness Assessment
   - ✅ 70% requirement note

### **🌐 VERCEL TESTING:**
1. **Visit your Vercel URL**
2. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment
4. **Test same features as local**

---

## 🔧 VERCEL TROUBLESHOOTING:

### **If Vercel still shows old version:**

#### **Option 1: Manual Vercel Deploy**
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/drive-nls-projects/cbr-ai-coach)
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
4. Wait for deployment to complete

#### **Option 2: Check Vercel Settings**
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Check "Git Integration" settings
3. Verify it's connected to correct GitHub repo
4. Ensure "Auto Deploy" is enabled

#### **Option 3: Clear Vercel Cache**
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to "Functions" tab
2. Clear any cached functions
3. Redeploy the project

### **If features still not visible on Vercel:**

#### **Cache Issues:**
1. **Hard refresh** browser (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Clear browser cache**
3. **Try incognito mode**
4. **Test on different browser**

#### **Deployment Issues:**
1. **Check Vercel build logs** for errors
2. **Verify environment variables** are set
3. **Check if build is successful**
