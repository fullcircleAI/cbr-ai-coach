# SYSTEMATIC TRANSLATION PLAN

I'm now translating ALL tests systematically. Here's the approach:

## Phase 1: Add to JSON (EN)
- Extract all questions from each test file
- Add to en.json in structured format
- Verify structure is correct

## Phase 2: Translate to Dutch (NL)
- Use AI translation for Dutch
- Review driving terminology accuracy
- Add to nl.json

## Phase 3: Translate to Arabic (AR)  
- Use AI translation for Arabic
- Ensure RTL compatibility
- Add to ar.json

## Phase 4: Update PracticeTest Component
- Add logic to load from JSON for each test
- Test each test works correctly
- Verify all 3 languages

## Progress:
‚úÖ Traffic Lights (10Q) - COMPLETE
üîÑ Hazard Perception (10Q) - IN PROGRESS
‚è≥ Priority Rules (20Q) - NEXT
‚è≥ Speed Limit (20Q)
‚è≥ Bicycle Interactions (25Q)
... (continuing with all 21 tests)

**Estimated Time: 4-6 hours for all 420 questions**

Let me continue...
